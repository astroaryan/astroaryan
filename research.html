<center> ​Astronomy Research Project #1 - Orbit Determination of minor planet 2003 UD8 </center> 
</h2>

<h3> ​At the summer science program, I researched asteroid 2003 UD8 alongside my teammates Xin Ming Shen and Lily Schwalb. We determined the asteroid's orbital elements, found its apparent magnitude, and ran N-Body simulations to predict its orbit for the next 50 million years.  Key aspects of the research paper are presented below.
