#i might use that code below for a cool different background.
#.constellationgame{

#notes for future work -- i need to change the title of the deepsky document to P2A, and i should change the references on the
#other 3 documents.

#notes for future work - possibly build a DSO app for the 2nd tab of learn the constellations. maybe make a simple astrophysics quiz
#for the fourth tab. have it test basic equations. (wiens law, stefan-boltzman law, distance modulus, parallax, gravitation/escape velocity 
#or vis viva, eccentricity of orbits
#rayleighs criterion, lifetime of a star equation and mass luminosity relationship (power laws, difficult question), scharzchild radius of 
#a black hole, hubbles law, lyman series spectroscopy question
#temperature of the universe, maybe some other cool problems. lots of work though. i should take pictures and upload them instead. do it 
#in latex.
#remove my instagram in my footer. it's not appropriate. replace it with my github account or replace it with a publication site -- once i get published?


#i can come back to finishing the research page after I complete my research with dr. gatkine. don't forget to include the 4 cool EV scope photos
#as supplementary
